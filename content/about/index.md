## Myself

I am a software engineer with over four years of experience designing, writing, and testing software in Python & Golang.

I love to design, build, and refactor. I am passionate about clean architecture, clean code, and idiomatic best practices.

I am biased towards minimalism and simplicity:

> "Write programs that do one thing and do it well" - _The Unix Philosphy_

> "There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." - _The Zen of Python_

In my spare time, I enjoy building a deep understanding of topics across all areas of software engineering.


## This Site

As software engineers our careers are a never-ending journey of self-education, and we spend countless hours reading textbooks, documentation, guides, and forums. Content is often easy to come by, but truly excellent resources are rare and invaluable.

With this site I hope to provide high-quality, useful, and accessible software engineering resources to professionals and amateurs alike while sharpening my writing skills and leaving the Internet a little more free and open than I found it.
