## Myself

I am a software engineer with a decade of experience designing, building, and operating across various domains,
though I have a particular affinity for distributed databases, cloud storage,
and for some unfortunate reason, authentication and authorization.

I believe in building open-source software that is friendly to users, operators, and developers alike.

I love to design, build, and refactor.
I am passionate about clean architecture, clean code, and idiomatic best practices.

I am biased towards minimalism and simplicity:

> "Write programs that do one thing and do it well" - _The Unix Philosophy_

> "There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." - _The Zen of Python_

It is not lost on me that neither Linux nor Python has fulfilled these philosophical goals.

## This Site

As software engineers our careers are a never-ending journey of self-education, and we spend countless hours reading textbooks, documentation, guides, and forums. Content is often easy to come by, but truly excellent resources are rare and invaluable.

With this site I hope to provide high-quality, useful, and accessible software engineering resources to professionals and amateurs alike while sharpening my writing skills and leaving the Internet a little more free and open than I found it.
