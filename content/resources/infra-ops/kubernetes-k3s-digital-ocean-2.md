## 1. Ansible Inventory Basics

### Hosts, Host Groups, and Host Variables

Ansible works by running playbook tasks against an "inventory" of hosts.

To Ansible, a host is pretty much anything with an IP address that runs a standard operating system:
a cloud or local VM, a bare metal server, a Docker container, etc.

The two basic components of inventory are **host groups** and **host variables**.

#### Host Groups

Every host in an inventory belongs to at least two groups.

1. Every host belongs to the `all` group, except the implicit `localhost` used when no host is specified.
2. Every host also belongs to either:
    1. one or more groups assigned to it using static or dynamic inventory, or
    2. the `ungrouped` group for hosts

Every host `localhost`)

> There are two default groups: all and ungrouped.
> The all group contains every host.
> The ungrouped group contains all hosts that donâ€™t have another group aside from all. Every host will always belong to at least 2 groups (all and ungrouped or all and some other group). Though all and ungrouped are always present, they can be implicit and not appear in group listings like group_names.


You may have noticed warnings printed when running the droplet creation playbook:

```shell
[WARNING]: No inventory was parsed, only implicit localhost is available
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'
```

These warnings hint at the two main aspects of using inventory with Ansible:

1. Providing inventory to the `ansible-playbook` command
2. Indicating in a playbook which hosts in the inventory to run the tasks against

Since we did neither in our first command, Ansible fell back to the default implicit "localhost".
The playbook to create a DigitalOcean droplet was just run on our local machine.

The simplest way to build Ansible inventory is by hardcoding the IPs or hosts into static files, as described in
However, as we are dynamically provisioning infrastructure with a cloud provider, we generally do not have a way to know the host IPs ahead of time.

This is a common use case for Ansible, which is supported with [dynamic inventory plugins](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html).
Essentially, plugins will interface with a cloud provider, local hypervisor stack, or other
