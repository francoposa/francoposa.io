One of the defining characteristics of software engineering is that a single person or small team
can create, deploy, and operate a nontrivial application or entire system of software.
However, depending on the structure of our team, organization, or education,
we may rarely learn in any depth - if at all - how to deploy and operate our software in production.

These resources seek to bridge this gap and provide a path to understanding fundamental concepts
behind modern software infrastructure and operations, while defining automated, repeatable processes
which enable us to ship software, then ship it again and again and again.

Let's get to it.
