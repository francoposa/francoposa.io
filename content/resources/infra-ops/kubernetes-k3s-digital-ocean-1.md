## 1. Create a DigitalOcean Droplet

As the documentation states:

> DigitalOcean Droplets are Linux-based virtual machines (VMs) that run on
> top of virtualized hardware. Each Droplet you create is a new server
> you can use, either standalone or as part of a larger, cloud-based
> infrastructure.

With that in mind, follow the [Create Droplet Quickstart](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/quickstart/).
The size of the droplet does not matter much for this tutorial - the $5 droplet option is plenty for any testing or learning scenario, and k3s is intended to run in resource-constrained environments.
